# Block_autoload
Block autoload comments and messages in Facebook ==> Create a chrome extension

During reading Facebook news feed, if you hate something like "A friend is typing a comment..." or "Someone is typing a comment..." and then many comments appear and you don't want to read them, just want to hide them to read or watch what you like. So this is my temporary solution.

Solution: block autoload comments, but also block autoload messages ==> This is the reason why my solution is temporary.

Usage: Download ==> Install extension ==> use the "Ctrl+B" hotkey to switch between blocking and non-blocking mode.
